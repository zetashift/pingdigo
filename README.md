# Pongdigo

It's pong using Indigo!

### Starting dev server

First thing in order to run this project, is to install vite dependency. To do it run
`npm install`
To start Scala.js - Vite developement server, you first need to start incremental compilation for code.
It is done by running `sbt ~fastLinkJS` directly from shell of just `~fastLinkJS` from SBT shell instance.
The next step is to start the server. To do it, run `yarn dev` or if you use npm `npm run dev` in your terminal.

### Adding new dependencies

To add new dependencies, do it with 
`npm install ${dependencyName}`
